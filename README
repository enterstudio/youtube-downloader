Using some, for unix based systems, common tools to download movies
and optionally ripping the audio from them.

USAGE:
youtube-downloader <youtube-url> [command]

COMMANDS:
- audio
  Downloads the video to a fifo-pipe, rips the audio and removes the video.
  If the file has already been downloaded the audio will be ripped but the
  file will be not be removed.
- rip or all
  Downloads the video and rips the audio

With no command set it will download the video.

EDITING FILENAME:
This script is set to use the Ruby Readline library, I've not found a way to
add a default value to the line to be read in.

But I've added the default title toe Readline history buffer so press the
up arrow key on your keyboard to get it filled in so you can change it.

DEPENDENCIES:
- cURL, fetch or wget. We try to be smart and choose a good one
  depending on the running system so this shouldn't be to big a deal.
- ffmpeg, for ripping the audio
- hpricot gem, if you install through rubygems it will be installed automatically
- htmlentities gem

INSTALLATION:
Make sure you can download gems from gemcutter.org and then
And then:
  # gem install youtube-downloader

CONFIGURATION:
In your home directory create a file named .youtube-downloader
with these values:

---
# To download the files to the current directory set to .
:download_dir: .
:music_dir: .
:temp_dir: /tmp
:file_extension: flv

# If we want the timestamp on the files to be time of download instead
# of time of the file
:touch: true
