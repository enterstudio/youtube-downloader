Using some, for unix based systems, common tools to download movies
and optionally ripping the audio from them.

USAGE:
youtube-downloader <youtube-url> [command]

COMMANDS:
- audio
  rip the audio and then remove the video
- rip or all
  rips the audio

With no command set it will download the video.

DEPENDENCIES:
- cURL/fetch or wget. We try to be smart and choose a good one
  depending on the running system so this shouldn't be too big a deal.
- mplayer, for ripping the audio
- lame, for encoding the audio
- mkfifo, rm and touch ;)

CONFIGURATION:
At the top of the script there's some configuration variables, set
these to where you want to download your files. If you just want to
download them to the current directory where the script is called from
set the variables to a dot (.).
