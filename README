Using some, for unix based systems, common tools to download movies
and optionally ripping the audio from them.

USAGE:
youtube-downloader <youtube-url> [command]

COMMANDS:
- audio
  downloads the video to a fifo-pipe and start the processing directly
  <3 mkfifo :)
- rip or all
  rips the audio

With no command set it will download the video.

EDITING FILENAME:
This script is set to use the Ruby Readline library, I've not found a way to
add a default value to the line to be read in.

But I've added the default title toe Readline history buffer so press the
up arrow key on your keyboard to get it filled in so you can change it.

DEPENDENCIES:
- cURL, fetch or wget. We try to be smart and choose a good one
  depending on the running system so this shouldn't be to big a deal.
- mplayer, for ripping the audio
- lame, for encoding the audio
- mkfifo, rm and touch ;)

INSTALLATION:
Add support for the Github RubyGems repository (http://gems.github.com/).
And then:
  # gem install gaqzi-youtube-downloader

CONFIGURATION:
In your home directory create a file named .youtube-downloader
with these values:

---
# To download the files to the current directory set to .
:download_dir: .
:music_dir: .
:temp_dir: /tmp
:file_extension: flv

# If we want the timestamp on the files to be time of download instead
# of time of the file
:touch: true
